Example
-------

The basic syntax you need to run this tool is::

    # odoopartner -d 2158_cd -m res.partner -f vat -v VEV1234567

odoopartner will requiere a odoo instance configuration to now were to look,
this configuration includes server ip, protocol and port to connect. The tool
have some defaults defines, if you want to change it then you can add this
options to the command line you are writing.

The last example command configuration means:

- ``-d 2158_cd``: represent youre odoo instance data base name, in the example
  the data base is 2158_cd.
- ``-m res.partner``: indicate the odoo model into the qeuery will be made, in
  this case the partner model.
- ``-f vat``: indicate the name of the field used to make the query. In this
  case the field name is ``vat``.
- ``-v VEV1234567``: indicate the value of used to make the query. This is the
  value of the field given in ``-f``. In the example the value is a vat number
  for venezuela. If youre value is a string with separate string then you need
  to put youre value between semi colons like ``... -v "a string value" ...``.

The result given by odoopartner tool differ of the given values to the query:

1. If the record exist in the odoo instance data base will return the xml_id of
the record, something like this in your console output::

    xml_id  res_partner_mycompany_123

2. if the record do not exist in the odoo instance will try consult the seniat
page to get the information of the partner and to create a new record for this
partner by creating a csv file with the necesary data to be use to load the
new record via csv. The command will not return anything in youre command
line, only will add the csv file into the folder were you are running
odoopartner tool. this csv file will have the name of the format
``model_name_company_xxx``. In the example will be something like::

    # mycompany_res_partner_VEV1234567.csv

.. note:: If you run ``odoopartner`` with the --verbose option will show you in
 the console output the progess of the query.

3. If the record do not exist in the odoo instance neither in the seniat vat
consult page return anything. The script will create a csv file named
``mycompany_seniat_error.csv`` This is a csv with one field named ``value``
that indicate the values that fail the query and can not be created.

Extra options can be pass the company name to name the new csv files and
records to be created.
